# My Cypress BDD Project

This project demonstrates automated end-to-end testing of a web application using:

- **Cypress** as the test runner
- **Cucumber (BDD)** for behavior-driven development with `.feature` files and step definitions
- **Page Object Model** for cleaner test code organization
- **Custom Commands** for reusable Cypress commands
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD to run tests headlessly on push and pull requests

## Setup & Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Running Tests

### Open Cypress Test Runner (interactive mode)

```bash
npm run test
```

### Run tests headlessly in Chrome (CI mode)

```bash
npm run test:headless
```

---

## GitHub Actions

This project is integrated with GitHub Actions to run Cypress tests automatically on every push and pull request on the `main` branch.

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/cypress.yml`.

---

## Writing Tests

* Add BDD scenarios in `.feature` files under `cypress/integration/features/`
* Implement step definitions in `cypress/support/step_definitions/`
* Use Page Object Model classes from `cypress/support/pageObjects/`
* Use reusable custom commands defined in `cypress/support/commands.js`

---

## Troubleshooting

* If tests fail due to element not found, check selectors in your Page Object files.
* For issues with dependencies, delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again.
* Refer to [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io) and [Cucumber preprocessor docs](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) for more help.
